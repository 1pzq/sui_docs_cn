zkLogin是Sui的一种基元，它使您能够使用OAuth凭证从Sui地址发送交易，而无需公开将两者关联起来。

zkLogin设计时考虑了以下目标：

- **简化入门流程：** zkLogin使您能够使用熟悉的OAuth登录流程在Sui上进行交易，消除了处理加密密钥或记住助记词的摩擦。
- **自我托管：** zkLogin交易需要用户通过标准的OAuth登录流程进行批准，OAuth提供商不能代表用户进行交易。
- **安全性：** zkLogin是一种两因素身份验证方案：发送交易需要来自最近OAuth登录的凭据和不由OAuth提供商管理的盐。攻击者即使攻击了OAuth帐户，也不能从用户对应的Sui地址进行交易，除非它们单独攻击了盐。
- **隐私：** 零知识证明阻止第三方将Sui地址与其相应的OAuth标识符关联起来。
- **可选的已验证身份：** 用户可以选择验证用于派生特定Sui地址的OAuth标识符。这为可验证的链上身份层奠定了基础。
- **可访问性：** 由于Sui的[密码学灵活性](./transaction-auth/signatures.mdx)，zkLogin是几种原生Sui签名方案之一。它与其他Sui基元（如赞助交易和多重签名）集成。
- **严谨性：** zkLogin的代码已由两家专门从事零知识的公司进行了独立的[审计](https://github.com/sui-foundation/security-audits/blob/main/docs/zksecurity_zklogin-circuits.pdf)。用于创建通用参考字符串的公共zkLogin仪式吸引了100多名参与者的贡献。

## 集成指南

以下是支持zkLogin启用交易的钱包或前端应用程序必须实现的高级流程：

1. 钱包创建一个临时KeyPair。
1. 钱包提示用户完成OAuth登录流程，其中包含与临时公钥对应的随机数。
1. 在收到JWT令牌后，钱包获取零知识证明。
1. 钱包基于JWT令牌获取唯一的用户盐。OAuth主题标识符和盐可用于计算zkLogin Sui地址。
1. 钱包使用临时私钥签署交易。
1. 钱包提交交易，包括临时签名和零知识证明。

让我们深入了解具体的实现细节。

## 安装zkLogin TypeScript SDK

要在项目中使用zkLogin TypeScript SDK，请在项目根目录中运行以下命令：

```typescript
npm install @mysten/zklogin

# If you want to use the latest experimental version:
npm install @mysten/zklogin@experimental
```

## 配置与OpenID提供商的开发者账户

Sui目前支持Google、Facebook和Twitch。将来将启用更多兼容OpenID的提供商。

例如，以下TypeScript代码可用于构建用于测试的登录URL。

```typescript
const REDIRECT_URI = '<YOUR_SITE_URL>';

const params = new URLSearchParams({
	// See below for how to configure client ID and redirect URL
	client_id: $CLIENT_ID,
	redirect_uri: $REDIRECT_URL,
	response_type: 'id_token',
	scope: 'openid',
	// See below for details about generation of the nonce
	nonce: nonce,
});

const loginURL = `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?${params}`;
```

你必须在每个提供商中配置客户端ID（`$CLIENT_ID`）和重定向URL（`$REDIRECT_URL`）：

### Google

1. 注册Google Cloud账户并访问[仪表板](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard)。
1. 选择"APIs & Services"然后选择"Credentials"，在那里可以找到客户端ID。设置重定向URL。这应该是钱包或应用程序前端。

1. 在"Features"下的"OAuth & Permissions"中设置重定向URL。这应该是钱包或应用程序前端。

	![1](images/zklogin-slack3.png "设置重定向URL")

## 获取JWT令牌

1. 生成一个临时KeyPair。按照在传统钱包中生成KeyPair的相同过程进行。详细信息请参见 [Sui SDK](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/cryptography/keypairs)。

1. 为临时KeyPair设置过期时间。钱包决定最大时期是当前时期还是以后的时期。钱包还确定是否用户可以调整此设置。

1. 使用配置的客户端ID、重定向URL、临时公钥和随机数组装OAuth URL：这是应用程序发送给用户以完成登录流程的内容，其中包括计算的[随机数](#notations)。

```typescript
import { generateNonce, generateRandomness } from '@mysten/zklogin';

const FULLNODE_URL = 'https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io'; // replace with the RPC URL you want to use
const suiClient = new SuiClient({ url: FULLNODE_URL });
const { epoch, epochDurationMs, epochStartTimestampMs } = await suiClient.getLatestSuiSystemState();

const maxEpoch = Number(epoch) + 2; // this means the ephemeral key will be active for 2 epochs from now.
const ephemeralKeyPair = new Ed25519Keypair();
const randomness = generateRandomness();
const nonce = generateNonce(ephemeralKeyPair.getPublicKey(), maxEpoch, randomness);
```
T认证流URL可以使用 `$CLIENT_ID`、`$REDIRECT_URL` 和 `$NONCE` 构建。

对于某些提供商（在“仅认证流”中选择“是”），JWT令牌可以立即在认证流之后的重定向URL中找到。

对于其他提供商（在“仅认证流”中选择“否”），认证流只返回重定向URL中的代码（`$AUTH_CODE`）。要检索JWT令牌，需要使用“Token Exchange URL”进行额外的POST调用。

| Provider | Auth Flow URL | Token Exchange URL | Auth Flow Only |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Google | `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=$CLIENT_ID&response_type=id_token&redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URL&scope=openid&nonce=$NONCE` | N/A | Yes |
| Facebook | `https://www.facebook.com/v17.0/dialog/oauth?client_id=$CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URL&scope=openid&nonce=$NONCE&response_type=id_token` | N/A | Yes |
| Twitch | `https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?client_id=$CLIENT_ID&force_verify=true&lang=en&login_type=login&redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URL& response_type=id_token&scope=openid&nonce=$NONCE` | N/A | Yes |
| Kakao | `https://kauth.kakao.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URL&nonce=$NONCE` | `https://kauth.kakao.com/oauth/token?grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URL&code=$AUTH_CODE` | No |
| Apple | `https://appleid.apple.com/auth/authorize?client_id=$CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URL&scope=email&response_mode=form_post&response_type=code%20id_token&nonce=$NONCE` | N/A | Yes |
| Slack | `https://slack.com/openid/connect/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URL&nonce=$NONCE&scope=openid` | `https://slack.com/api/openid.connect.token?code=$AUTH_CODE&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET` | No |

## 解码JWT

在成功重定向后，身份提供商将JWT令牌作为URL参数附加（以Google流程为例）

```
http://host/auth?id_token=tokenPartA.tokenPartB.tokenPartC&authuser=0&prompt=none
```

`id_token` 参数是以编码格式的JWT令牌。您可以通过将其粘贴到 [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) 网站中来验证编码令牌的正确性并调查其结构。

要解码JWT，您可以使用类似 `jwt_decode` 的库，并将响应映射到提供的类型 `JwtPayload`：

```typescript

const decodedJwt = jwt_decode(encodedJWT) as JwtPayload;

export interface JwtPayload {
   iss?: string;
   sub?: string;  //Subject ID
   aud?: string[] | string;
   exp?: number;
   nbf?: number;
   iat?: number;
   jti?: string;
}
```

## 用户盐管理

在计算zkLogin Sui地址时使用用户盐（请参见 [定义](#address-definition)）。盐必须是一个16字节的值，或者小于`2n**128n`的整数。应用程序在维护用户盐时有几个选项：
1. 客户端端：
   - 选项1：在访问钱包时请求用户输入盐，将责任转移到用户身上，用户需要记住盐。
   - 选项2：浏览器或移动存储：确保适当的工作流程，以防止用户在更改设备或浏览器时失去钱包访问。一种方法是在设置新钱包时通过电子邮件发送盐。
2. 公开一个端点的后端服务，该端点为每个用户一致返回唯一的盐。
   - 选项3：在传统数据库中（例如 `user` 或 `password` 表）存储从用户标识符（例如 `sub`）到用户盐的映射。每个用户的盐是唯一的。
   - 选项4：实现一个服务，保留主种子值，并通过验证和解析JWT令牌派生用户盐，使用密钥派生，例如使用 `HKDF(ikm = seed, salt = iss || aud, info = sub)` 在 [这里](https://github.com/MystenLabs/fastcrypto/blob/e6161f9279510e89bd9e9089a09edc018b30fbfe/fastcrypto/src/hmac.rs#L121)定义。请注意，此选项不允许在主种子上进行旋转或更改客户端ID（即aud），否则将导致派生不同用户地址，可能会导致资金丢失。

以下是Mysten Labs维护的盐服务器的示例请求和响应（使用选项4）。如果您希望使用Mysten运行的盐服务器，请联系我们以将您注册的客户端ID列入白名单。只有使用已列入白名单的客户端ID进行身份验证的有效JWT令牌才会被接受。

```bash
curl -X POST https://salt.api.mystenlabs.com/get_salt -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"token": "$JWT_TOKEN"}'

Response: {"salt":"129390038577185583942388216820280642146"}
```

用户盐用于断开OAuth标识符（sub）与链上Sui地址之间的关联，以避免将Web2凭据与Web3凭据关联起来。尽管失去或滥用盐可能会启用此关联，但不会危及资金控制或zkLogin资产权限。请参阅更多讨论 [这里](#security-and-privacy)。

## 获取用户的Sui地址

一旦OAuth流程完成，JWT令牌可以在重定向URL中找到。结合用户盐，可以按照以下步骤派生zkLogin地址：

```typescript
import { jwtToAddress } from '@mysten/zklogin';

const zkLoginUserAddress = jwtToAddress(jwt, userSalt);
```

## 获取零知识证明

下一步是获取ZK证明。这是对临时密钥对的一种证明，证明临时密钥对是有效的。

首先，生成扩展的临时公钥，以将其用作ZKP的输入。

```typescript
import { getExtendedEphemeralPublicKey } from '@mysten/zklogin';

const extendedEphemeralPublicKey = getExtendedEphemeralPublicKey(ephemeralKeyPair.getPublicKey());
```

如果之前的临时密钥对已过期或无法访问，您需要获取一个新的ZK证明。

由于在客户端生成ZK证明可能会消耗大量资源并且潜在地较慢，建议钱包使用专用于ZK证明生成的后端服务端点。

有两个选项：
1. 调用Mysten Labs维护的证明服务
1. 在您的后端使用提供的Docker映像运行证明服务。

### 调用Mysten Labs维护的证明服务

如果您希望在Mainnet上使用Mysten运行的ZK Proving Service，请联系我们，以便将您的注册客户端ID列入白名单。仅接受使用列入白名单的客户端ID进行身份验证的有效JWT令牌。

要使用`prover-dev`端点，您无需列入白名单客户端ID。请注意，使用`prover-dev`端点生成的证明只能提交用于Devnet zkLogin交易，将其提交到Testnet或Mainnet将失败。

| 网络 | Prover URL |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Mainnet, Testnet | https://prover.mystenlabs.com/v1 |
| Devnet | https://prover-dev.mystenlabs.com/v1 |

您可以使用BigInt或Base64编码来处理 `extendedEphemeralPublicKey`，`jwtRandomness`和 `salt`。以下示例展示了两个样本请求，第一个使用BigInt编码，第二个使用Base64。

```bash
curl -X POST $PROVER_URL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"jwt":"$JWT_TOKEN", \
"extendedEphemeralPublicKey":"84029355920633174015103288781128426107680789454168570548782290541079926444544", \
"maxEpoch":"10", \
"jwtRandomness":"100681567828351849884072155819400689117", \
"salt":"248191903847969014646285995941615069143", \
"keyClaimName":"sub" \
}'

curl -X POST $PROVER_URL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"jwt":"$JWT_TOKEN", \
"extendedEphemeralPublicKey":"ucbuFjDvPnERRKZI2wa7sihPcnTPvuU//O5QPMGkkgA=", \
"maxEpoch":"10", \
"jwtRandomness":"S76Qi8c/SZlmmotnFMr13Q==", \
"salt":"urgFnwIxJ++Ooswtf0Nn1w==", \
"keyClaimName":"sub" \
}'
```

### 如何处理CORS错误

为了避免在前端应用中可能出现的CORS错误，建议将此调用委托给后端服务。

响应可以映射到zkLogin SDK的 `getZkLoginSignature` 方法的输入参数类型。

```typescript
const proofResponse = await post('/your-internal-api/zkp/get', zkpRequestPayload);

export type PartialZkLoginSignature = Omit<
	Parameters<typeof getZkLoginSignature>['0']['inputs'],
	'addressSeed'
>;
const partialZkLoginSignature = proofResponse as PartialZkLoginSignature;
```

### Run the proving service in your backend

1. Download two images from from Docker Hub [repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mysten/zklogin/general) that are tagged as `prover` and `prover-fe`.

1. Download the [Groth16 proving key zkey file](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/proving-circuits/) that will be later used as an argument to run the prover. There are zkeys available for Mainnet and Testnet, as well as a test zkey for Devnet. See [the Ceremony section](#ceremony) for more details on how the main proving key is generated. Please install [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) which is needed before downloading the zkey.

	- Main zkey (for Mainnet and Testnet)
		```bash
		wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sui-foundation/zklogin-ceremony-contributions/main/download-main-zkey.sh | bash
		```
	- Test zkey (for Devnet)
		```bash
		wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sui-foundation/zklogin-ceremony-contributions/main/download-test-zkey.sh | bash
		```

	- To verify the download contains the correct zkey file, you can run the following command to check the Blake2b hash: `b2sum ${file_name}.zkey`.

		| Network | zkey file name | Hash |
		| ------------ | ----------   | -------- |
		| Mainnet, Testnet |  `zkLogin-main.zkey` | `060beb961802568ac9ac7f14de0fbcd55e373e8f5ec7cc32189e26fb65700aa4e36f5604f868022c765e634d14ea1cd58bd4d79cef8f3cf9693510696bcbcbce` |
		| Devnet | `zkLogin-test.zkey` | `686e2f5fd969897b1c034d7654799ee2c3952489814e4eaaf3d7e1bb539841047ae8ee5fdcdaca5f4ddd76abb5a8e8eb77b44b693a2ba9d4be57e94292b26ce2` |

1. Run `prover` at `PORT1` with the downloaded zkey. This needs to be run on Linux-based machines (amd64). Further, we recommended using at least 16 vcpu, preferably an AMD cpu and at least 16gb ram for production use. Whereas 8 vcpu, 8gb ram works for testing (but its not fast).

	```bash
	docker run \
	-e ZKEY=/app/binaries/zkLogin.zkey \
	-e WITNESS_BINARIES=/app/binaries \
	-v <path_to_zkLogin.zkey>:/app/binaries/zkLogin.zkey \
	-p PORT1:8080 \
	<prover-image>
	```

1. Run `prover-fe` at `PORT2`:

	```bash
	docker run \
		-e PROVER_URI='http://localhost:PORT1/input' \
		-e NODE_ENV=production \
		-e DEBUG=zkLogin:info,jwks \
		-p PORT2:8080 \
		<prover-fe-image> 8080
	```

1. Expose the `prover-fe` service appropriately and keep the prover service internal.
1. To call the proving service, the following two endpoints are supported:
   - `/ping`: To test if the service is up. Running `curl http://localhost:PORT2/ping` should return `pong`.
   - `/v1`: The request and response are the same as the Mysten Labs maintained service.

A few things to note:

- If you want to compile the prover from scratch (for performance reasons), please see our fork of [rapidsnark](https://github.com/MystenLabs/rapidsnark#compile-prover-in-server-mode). You'd need to compile and launch the prover in server mode.

- Setting `DEBUG=*` turns on all logs in the prover-fe service some of which may contain PII. Consider using DEBUG=zkLogin:info,jwks in production environments.

- If you are seeing the error message "Call to rapidsnark service took longer than 15s", consider increasing the timeout by setting the environment variable `PROVER_TIMEOUT` to a higher value. For example, `PROVER_TIMEOUT=30`.

## Assemble the zkLogin signature and submit the transaction

First, sign the transaction bytes with the ephemeral private key using the key pair generated previously. This is the same as [traditional KeyPair signing](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/cryptography/keypairs). Make sure that the transaction `sender ` is also defined.

```typescript
 const ephemeralKeyPair = new Ed25519Keypair();

const client = new SuiClient({ url: "<YOUR_RPC_URL>" });

const txb = new TransactionBlock();

txb.setSender(zkLoginUserAddress);

const { bytes, signature: userSignature } = await txb.sign({
   client,
   signer: ephemeralKeyPair, // This must be the same ephemeral key pair used in the ZKP request
});
```

Next, generate an address seed by combining `userSalt`, `sub` (subject ID), and `aud` (audience).

Set the address seed and the partial zkLogin signature to be the `inputs` parameter.

You can now serialize the zkLogin signature by combining the ZK proof (`inputs`),
the `maxEpoch`, and the ephemeral signature (`userSignature`).

```typescript
import { genAddressSeed, getZkLoginSignature } from "@mysten/zklogin";

const addressSeed : string = genAddressSeed(BigInt(userSalt!), "sub", decodedJwt.sub, decodedJwt.aud).toString();

const zkLoginSignature : SerializedSignature = getZkLoginSignature({
   inputs: {
      ...partialZkLoginSignature,
      addressSeed
   },
   maxEpoch,
   userSignature,
});
```

Finally, execute the transaction.

```typescript
client.executeTransactionBlock({
	transactionBlock: bytes,
	signature: zkLoginSignature,
});
```

## Caching the ephemeral private key and ZK proof

As previously documented, each ZK proof is tied to an ephemeral key pair. So you can reuse the proof to sign any number of transactions until the ephemeral key pair expires (until the current epoch crosses `maxEpoch`).

You might want to cache the ephemeral key pair along with the ZKP for future uses.

However, the ephemeral key pair needs to be treated as a secret akin to a key pair in a traditional wallet. This is because if both the ephemeral private key and ZK proof are revealed to an attacker, then they can typically sign any transaction on behalf of the user (using the same process described previously).

Consequently, you should not store them persistently in an unsecure storage location, on any platform. For example, on browsers, use session storage instead of local storage to store the ephemeral key pair and the ZK proof.


# How zkLogin Works

In rough sketches, the zkLogin protocol relies on the following:

1. A JWT token is a signed payload from OAuth providers, including a user-defined field named nonce. zkLogin leverages [the OpenID Connect OAuth flow](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) by defining the nonce as a public key and an expiry epoch.
1. The wallet stores an ephemeral KeyPair, where the ephemeral public key is defined in the nonce. The ephemeral private key signs transactions for a brief session, eliminating the need for user memorization.
   The Groth16 zero-knowledge proof is generated based on the JWT token, concealing privacy-sensitive fields.
1. A transaction is submitted on-chain with the ephemeral signature and the ZK proof. Sui authorities execute the transaction after verifying the ephemeral signature and the proof.
1. Instead of deriving the Sui address based on a public key, the zkLogin address is derived from `sub` (that uniquely identifies the user per provider), `iss` (identifies the provider), `aud` (identifies the application) and `user_salt` (a value that unlinks the OAuth identifier with the on-chain address).

(Step 0) We use Groth16 for our protocol's zkSNARK instantiation, requiring a singular generation of a structured common reference string (CRS) linked to the circuit. A ceremony is conducted to generate the CRS, which is used to produce the proving key in the ZK Proving Service, the verifying key in Sui Authority. See [the Ceremony section](#ceremony) for more details.

(Step 1-3) The user begins by logging into an OpenID Provider (OP) to obtain a JWT token containing a defined nonce. In particular, the user generates an _ephemeral_ KeyPair `(eph_sk, eph_pk)` and embed `eph_pk`, along with expiry times (`max_epoch`) and randomness (`jwt_randomness`), into the nonce (see [definition](#notations)). After the user completes the OAuth login flow, an JWT token can be found in the redirect URL in the application.

(Step 4-5) The application frontend then sends the JWT token to a salt service. The salt service returns the unique `user_salt` based on `iss, aud, sub` upon validation of the JWT token.

(Step 6-7) The user sends the ZK proving service the JWT token, user salt, ephemeral public key, jwt randomness, key claim name (i.e. `sub`). The proving service generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof that takes these as private inputs and does the following: (a) Checks the nonce is derived correctly [as defined](#notations) (b) Checks that key claim value matches the corresponding field in the JWT, (c) Verifies the RSA signature from OP on the JWT, and (d) the address is consistent with the key claim value and user salt.

(Step 8): The application computes the user address based on iss, aud, sub, aud. This step can be done independently as long as the application has a valid JWT token.

(Step 9-10) A transaction is signed using the ephemeral private key to generate an ephemeral signature. Finally, the user submits the transaction along with the ephemeral signature, ZK proof and other inputs to Sui.

(After Step 10) After submitted on chain, Sui Authorities verify the ZK proof against the provider JWKs from storage (agreed upon in consensus) and also the ephemeral signature.

## Entities

1. Application frontend: This describes the wallet or frontend application that supports zkLogin. This frontend is responsible for storing the ephemeral private key, directing users to complete the OAuth login flow, creating and signing a zkLogin transaction.

2. Salt Backup Service: This is a backend service responsible for returning a salt per unique user. See [integration guide](#integration-guide) for other strategies to maintain salt.

3. ZK Proving Service: This is a backend service responsible for generating ZK proofs based on JWT token, JWT randomness, user salt and max epoch. This proof is submitted on-chain along with the ephemeral signature for a zkLogin transaction.

## Address definition

The address is computed on the following inputs:

1. The address flag: `zk_login_flag = 0x05` for zkLogin address. This serves as a domain separator as a signature scheme defined in [crypto agility](./transaction-auth/signatures.mdx).

1. `kc_name_F = hashBytesToField(kc_name, maxKCNameLen)`: Name of the key claim, e.g., `sub`. The sequence of bytes is mapped to a field element in BN254 using `hashBytesToField` (defined below).

1. `kc_value_F = hashBytesToField(kc_value, maxKCValueLen)`: The value of the key claim mapped using `hashBytesToField`.

1. `aud_F = hashBytesToField(aud, maxAudValueLen)`: The Relying Party (RP) identifier. See [definition](#terminology-and-notations).

1. `iss`: The OpenID Provider (OP) identifier. See [definition](#terminology-and-notations).

1. `user_salt`: A value introduced to unlink the OAuth identifier with the on-chain address.

Finally, we derive `zk_login_address = Blake2b_256(zk_login_flag, iss_L, iss, addr_seed)` where `addr_seed = Poseidon_BN254(kc_name_F, kc_value_F, aud_F, Poseidon_BN254(user_salt)`.

## Terminology and notations

See below for all relevant OpenID terminology defined in [spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Terminology) and how they are used in zkLogin, along with definitions for protocol details.

### OpenID provider (OP)

OAuth 2.0 authorization server that is capable of authenticating the end-user and providing claims to a relying party about the authentication event and the end-user. This is identified in the `iss` field in JWT token payload. Currently zkLogin supported OPs include Google, Facebook, and Twitch, and more compatible providers will be enabled in the future.

### Relying party (RP) or client

OAuth 2.0 client application requiring end-user authentication and claims from an OpenID provider. This is assigned by OP when the developer creates the application. This is identified in the `aud` field in JWT token payload. This refers to any zkLogin enabled wallet or application.

### Subject identifier (sub)

Locally unique and never reassigned identifier within the issuer for the end-user, which is intended to be consumed by the RP. Sui uses this as the key claim to derive user address.

### JWK (JSON Web Key)

A JSON data structure that represents a set of public keys for an OP. A public endpoint (e.g. https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs) can be queried to retrieve the valid public keys corresponding to `kid` for the provider. Upon matching with the `kid` in the header of a JWT token, the JWT token can be verified against the payload and its corresponding JWK. In Sui, all authorities call the JWK endpoints independently, and update the latest view of JWKs for all supported providers during protocol upgrades. The correctness of JWKs is guaranteed by the quorum (2f+1) of validator stake.

### JWT Token (JSON Web Token)

JWT token can be found in the redirect URL to RP after the user completes the OAuth login flow (i.e. `https://redirect.com?id_token=$JWT_TOKEN`). The JWT token contains a `header`, `payload` and a `signature`. The signature is an RSA signature that can be verified against `jwt_message = header + . + payload` and its JWK identified by `kid`. The `payload` contains a JSON of many claims that is a name, value pair. See below for the specific claims that are relevant to the zkLogin protocol.

**Header**

| Name | Example Value                            | Usage                                                     |

**Payload**

| Name  | Example Value                                                            | Usage                                                                                                                                                      |

| nonce | hTPpgF7XAKbW37rEUS6pEVZqmoI                                              | A value set by the relying party. The zkLogin enabled wallet is required to set this to the hash of ephemeral public key, an expiry time and a randomness. |

For a zkLogin transaction, we do not use the `iat` and `exp` claims (i.e., timestamp). This is because we provide a different way for users to specify expiry times, namely via `nonce`.

### Key Claim

We call the claim used to derive a users' address as the "key claim" e.g., sub or email. Naturally, we only want to use claims that are fixed once and never changed again. For zkLogin, we currently support sub as the key claim because OpenID spec mandates that providers do not change this identifier. In the future, this can be extended to use email, username, etc.

### Notations

1. `(eph_sk, eph_pk)`: Ephemeral key pair refers to the private and public key pair used to produce ephemeral signatures. The signing mechanism is the same as traditional transaction signing, but it is ephemeral because it is only stored for a short session and can be refreshed upon new OAuth sessions. The ephemeral public key is used to compute nonce.
2. `nonce`: An application-defined field embedded in the JWT token payload, computed as the hash of the ephemeral public key, JWT randomness, and the maximum epoch (Sui's defined expiry epoch). Specifically, a zkLogin compatible nonce is required to passed in as `nonce = ToBase64URL(Poseidon_BN254([ext_eph_pk_bigint / 2^128, ext_eph_pk_bigint % 2^128, max_epoch, jwt_randomness]).to_bytes()[len - 20..])` where `ext_eph_pk_bigint` is the BigInt representation of `ext_eph_pk`.
3. `ext_eph_pk`: The byte representation of an ephemeral public key (`flag || eph_pk`). Size varies depending on the choice of the signature scheme (denoted by the flag, defined in [Signatures](./transaction-auth/signatures.mdx)).
4. `user_salt`: A value introduced to unlink the OAuth identifier with the on-chain address.
5. `max_epoch`: The epoch at which the JWT token expires. This is u64 used in Sui.
6. `kc_name`: The key claim name, e.g. `sub`.
7. `kc_value`: The key claim value, e.g. `110463452167303000000`.
8. `hashBytesToField(str, maxLen)`: Hashes the ASCII string to a field element using the Poseidon hash.

## Ceremony

To preserve privacy of the OAuth artifacts, a zero-knowledge proof of possession of the artifacts is provided. zkLogin employs the Groth16 zkSNARK to instantiate the zero-knowledge proofs, as it is the most efficient general-purpose zkSNARK in terms of proof size and verification efficiency.

However, Groth16 needs a computation-specific Common Reference String (CRS) to be setup by a trusted party. With zkLogin expected to ensure the safe-keeping of high value transactions and the integrity of critical smart contracts, we cannot base the security of the system on the honesty of a single entity. Hence, to generate the CRS for the zkLogin circuit, it is vital to run a protocol which bases its security on the assumed honesty of a small fraction of a large number of parties.

### What is the ceremony?

The Sui zkLogin ceremony is essentially a cryptographic multi-party computation (MPC) performed by a diverse group of participants to generate this CRS. We follow the MPC protocol [MMORPG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1050.pdf) described by Bowe, Gabizon and Miers. The protocol roughly proceeds in 2 phases. The first phase results in a series of powers of a secret quantity tau in the exponent of an elliptic curve element. Since this phase is circuit-agnostic, we adopted the result of the existing community contributed [perpetual powers of tau](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/perpetualpowersoftau/tree/master). Our ceremony was the second phase, which is specific to the zkLogin circuit.

The MMORPG protocol is a sequential protocol, which allows an indefinite number of parties to participate in sequence, without the need of any prior synchronization or ordering. Each party needs to download the output of the previous party, generate entropy of its own and then layer it on top of the received result, producing its own contribution, which is then relayed to the next party. The protocol guarantees security, if at least one of the the participants follows the protocol faithfully, generates strong entropy and discards it reliably.

### How was the ceremony performed?

We sent invitations to 100+ people with diverse backgrounds and affiliations: Sui validators, cryptographers, web3 experts, world-renowned academicians, and business leaders. We planned the ceremony to take place on the dates September 12-18, 2023, but allowed participants to join when they wanted with no fixed slots.

Since the MPC is sequential, each contributor needed to wait till the previous contributor finished in order to receive the previous contribution, follow the MPC steps and produce their own contribution. Due to this structure, we provisioned a queue where participants waited, while those who joined before them finished. To authenticate participants, we sent a unique activation code to each of them. The activation code was the secret key of a signing key pair, which had a dual purpose: it allowed the coordination server to associate the participant's email with the contribution, and to verify the contribution with the corresponding public key.

Participants had two options to contribute: through a browser or a docker. The browser option was more user-friendly for contributors to participate as everything happens in the browser. The Docker option required Docker setup but is more transparent—the Dockerfile and contributor source code are open-sourced and the whole process is verifiable. Moreover, the browser option utilizes [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) while the Docker option utilizes [Kobi's implementation](https://github.com/iseriohn/phase2-bn254). This provided software variety and contributors could choose to contribute by whichever method they trust. In addition, participants could generate entropy via entering random text or making random cursor movements.

The zkLogin circuit and the ceremony client [code](https://github.com/sui-foundation/zk-ceremony-client) were made open source and the links were made available to the participants to review before the ceremony. In addition, we also posted these developer docs and an [audit report](https://github.com/sui-foundation/security-audits/blob/main/docs/zksecurity_zklogin-circuits.pdf) on the circuit from zkSecurity. We adopted [challenge #0081](https://pse-trusted-setup-ppot.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/challenge_0081) (resulting from 80 community contributions) from [perpetual powers of tau](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/perpetualpowersoftau/tree/master/0080_carter_response) in phase 1, which is circuit agnostic. We applied the output of the [Drand](http://drand.love) random beacon at epoch #3298000 to remove bias. For phase 2, our ceremony had 111 contributions, 82 from browser and 29 from docker. Finally, we applied the output of the Drand random beacon at epoch #3320606 to remove bias from contributions. All intermediate files can be reproduced following instructions [here](https://github.com/sui-foundation/zklogin-ceremony-contributions/blob/main/phase1/README.md) for phase 1 and [here](https://github.com/sui-foundation/zklogin-ceremony-contributions/blob/main/phase2/README.md) for phase 2.

## Finalization

The final CRS along with the transcript of contribution of every participant is available in a public repository. Contributors received both the hash of the previous contribution they were working on and the resulting hash after their contribution, displayed on-screen and sent via email. They can compare these hashes with the transcripts publicly available on the ceremony site. In addition, anyone is able to check that the hashes are computed correctly and each contribution is properly incorporated in the finalized parameters.

Eventually, the final CRS was used to generate the proving key and verifying key. The proving key is used to generate zero knowledge proof for zkLogin, stored with the ZK proving service. The verifying key was [deployed](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/13822) as part of the validator software (protocol version 25 in [release 1.10.1](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/mainnet-v1.10.1)) that is used to verify the zkLogin transaction on Sui.

## Security and Privacy

We'll walk through all zkLogin artifacts, their security assumptions, and the consequences of loss or exposure.

## JWT Token

The JWT token's validity is scoped on the client ID (i.e. aud) to prevent phishing attacks. The same origin policy for the proof prevents the JWT token obtained for a malicious application from being used for zkLogin. The JWT token for the client ID is sent directly to the application frontend through the redirect URL. A leaked JWT token for the specific client ID can compromise user privacy, as these tokens frequently hold sensitive information like usernames and emails. Furthermore, if a backend salt server is responsible for user salt management, the JWT token could potentially be exploited to retrieve the user's salt, which introduces additional risks.

However, a JWT leak does not mean loss of funds as long as the corresponding ephemeral private key is safe.

## User Salt

The user salt is required to get access to the zkLogin wallet. This value is essential for both ZK proof generation and zkLogin address derivation.

The leak of user salt does not mean loss of funds, but it enables the attacker to associate the user's subject identifier (i.e. `sub`) with the Sui address. This can be problematic depending on whether pairwise or public subject identifiers are in use. In particular, there is no problem if pairwise IDs are used (e.g., Facebook) as the subject identifier is unique per RP. However, with public reusable IDs (e.g., Google and Twitch), the globally unique sub value can be used to identify users.

## Ephemeral Private Key

The ephemeral private key's lifespan is tied to the maximum epoch specified in nonce for creating a valid ZK proof. Should it be misplaced, a new ephemeral private key can be generated for transaction signing, accompanied by a freshly generated ZK proof using a new nonce. However, if the ephemeral private key is compromised, acquiring the user salt and the valid ZK proof would be necessary to move funds.

## Proof

Obtaining the proof itself cannot create a valid zkLogin transaction because an ephemeral signature over the transaction is also needed.

## Privacy

By default, there is no linking between the OAuth subject identifier (i.e. `sub`) and a Sui address. This is the purpose of the user salt.
The JWT token is not published on-chain by default. The revealed values include `iss`, `aud` and `kid` so that the public input hash can be computed, any sensitive fields such as `sub` are used as private inputs when generating the proof.

The ZK proving service and the salt service (if maintained) can link the user identity since the user salt and JWT token are known, but the two services are stateless by design.

In the future, the user can opt in to verify their OAuth identity associated with an Sui address on-chain.

## FAQ

### What providers is zkLogin compatible with?

zkLogin can support providers that work with OpenID Connect built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. This is a subset of OAuth 2.0 compatible providers. Sui currently supports Google, Facebook and Twitch. Other compatible providers will be enabled via protocol upgrades in the future.

### How is a zkLogin Wallet different from a traditional private key wallet?

Traditional private key wallets demand users to consistently recall mnemonics and passphrases, necessitating secure storage to prevent fund loss from private key compromise.

On the other hand, a zkLogin wallet only requires an ephemeral private key storage with session expiry and the OAuth login flow with expiry. Forgetting an ephemeral key does not result in loss of funds, because a user can always sign in again to generate a new ephemeral key and a new ZK proof.

### How is zkLogin different from MPC or Multisig wallets?

Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Multisig wallets rely on multiple keys or distributing multiple key shares and then defining a threshold value for accepting a signature.

zkLogin does not split any individual private keys, but ephemeral private keys are registered using a fresh nonce when the user authenticates with the OAuth provider. The primary advantage of zkLogin is that the user does not need to manage any persistent private key anywhere, not even with any private keys management techniques like MPC or Multisig.

You can think of zkLogin as a 2FA scheme for an address, where the first part is user's OAuth account and the second is the user's salt.

Furthermore, because Sui native supports Multisig wallets, one can always include one or more zkLogin signers inside a Multisig wallet for additional security, such as using the zkLogin part as 2FA in k-of-N settings.

### If my OAuth account is compromised, what happens to my zkLogin address?

Because zkLogin is a 2FA system, an attacker that has compromised your OAuth account cannot access your zkLogin address unless they have separately compromised your salt.

### If I lose access to my OAuth account, do I lose access to my zkLogin address?

Yes. You must be able to log into your OAuth account and produce a current JWT in order to use zkLogin.

### Does losing my OAuth credential mean the loss of funds in the zkLogin wallet?

A forgotten OAuth credential can typically be recovered by resetting the password in that provider.
In the unfortunate event where user's OAuth credentials get compromised, an adversary will still require to obtain `user_salt`, but also learn which wallet is used in order to take over that account. Note that modern `user_salt` providers may have additional 2FA security measures in place to prevent provision of user's salt even to entities that present a valid, non-expired JWT.

It's also important to highlight that due to the fact that zkLogin addresses do not expose any information about the user's identity or wallet used, targeted attacks by just monitoring the blockchain are more difficult.
Finally, on the unfortunate event where one loses access to their OAuth account permanently, access to that wallet is lost. But if recovery from a lost OAuth account is desired, a good suggestion for wallet providers is to support the native Sui Multisig functionality and add a backup method. Note that it's even possible to have a Multisig wallet that all signers are using zkLogin, i.e. an 1-of-2 Multisig zkLogin wallet where the first part is Google and the second Facebook OAuth, respectively.

### Can I convert or merge a traditional private key wallet into a zkLogin one, or vice versa?

No. The zkLogin wallet address is derived differently compared to a private key address.

### Will my zkLogin address ever change?

zkLogin address is derived from `sub`, `iss`, `aud` and `user_salt`.

The address will not change if the user logs in to the same wallet with the same OAuth provider, since `sub`, `iss`, `aud` and `user_salt` (see definitions) will remain unchanged in the JWT token, even though the JWT token itself may look different every time the user logs in.

However, if the user logs in with different OAuth providers, your address will change because the `iss` and `aud` are defined distinctly per provider.

In addition, each wallet or application maintains its own `user_salt`, so logging with the same provider for different wallets may also result in different addresses.

See more on address [definition](#address-definition).

### Can I have multiple addresses with the same OAuth provider?

Yes, this is possible by using a different wallet provider or different `user_salt` for each account. This is useful for separating funds between different accounts.

### Is a zkLogin Wallet custodial?

A zkLogin wallet is a non-custodial or unhosted wallet.

A custodial or hosted wallet is where a third party (the custodian) controls the private keys on behalf of a wallet user. No such third-party exists for zkLogin wallets.

Instead, a zkLogin wallet can be viewed as a 2-out-of-2 Multisig where the two credentials are the user's OAuth credentials (maintained by the user) and the salt. In other words, neither the OAuth provider, the wallet vendor, the ZK proving service or the salt service provider is a custodian.

### Generating a ZK proof is expensive, is a new proof required to be generated for every transaction?

No. Proof generation is only required when ephemeral KeyPair expires. Since the nonce is defined by the ephemeral public key (`eph_pk`) and expiry (`max_epoch`), the ZK proof is valid until what the expiry is committed to nonce in the JWT token. The ZK proof can be cached and the same ephemeral key can be used to sign transactions till it expires.

### Does zkLogin work on mobile?

zkLogin is a Sui native primitive and not a feature of a particular application or wallet. It can be used by any Sui developer, including on mobile.

### Is account recovery possible if the user loses the OAuth credentials?

Yes, the user can follow the OAuth providers' recovery flow. The ephemeral private key can be refreshed and after completing a new OAuth login flow, the user can obtain new ZK proof and sign transactions with the refreshed key.

### What are some assumptions for the zkLogin circuit?

Due to the way Groth16 works, we impose length restrictions on several fields in the JWT. Some of the fields that are length-restricted include aud, iss, the JWT's header and payload. For example, zkLogin can currently only work with aud values of up to length 120 (this value is not yet final). In general, we tried to make sure that the restrictions are as generous as possible. We have decided on these values after looking at as many JWTs that we could get our hands on.

### How is zkLogin different from other solutions that support social login?

While providing social login with Web2 credentials for Web3 wallet is not a new concept, the existing solutions have one or more of the trust assumptions:

1. Trust a different network or parties to verify Web2 credentials other than the Blockchain itself, usually involving a JWK oracle posted on-chain by a trusted party.
1. Trust some parties to manage a persistent private key, whether it uses MPC, threshold cryptography or secure enclaves.
1. Relying on smart contracts (account abstraction) to verify the JWT token on-chain with revealing privacy fields, or to verify ZK proofs on-chain which can be expensive.

Some of the existing deployed solutions rely on some of these assumptions. Web3Auth and DAuth social login requires deployment of custom OAuth verifiers to Web3auth Auth Network nodes to verify the JWT token. Magic Wallet and Privy also require custom OAuth identity issuer and verifiers to adopt the DID standard. All of the solutions still require persistent private keys management, either with trusted parties like AWS via delegation, Shamir Secret Sharing or MPC.

The key differentiators that zkLogin brings to Sui are:

1. Native Support in Sui: Unlike other solutions that are blockchain agnostic, zkLogin is deployed just for Sui. This means a zkLogin transaction can be combined with Multisig and sponsored transactions seamlessly.

2. Self-Custodial without additional trust: We leverage the nonce field in JWT token to commit to ephemeral public key, so no persistent private key management is required with any trusted parties. In addition, the JWK itself is an oracle agreed upon by the quorum of stakes by the validators with trusting any source of authority.

3. Full privacy: Nothing is required to submit on-chain except the ZK proof and the ephemeral signature.

4. Compatible with Existing Identity Providers: zkLogin is compatible with providers that adopt OpenID Connect. No need to trust any intermediate identity issuers or verifiers other than the OAuth providers themselves.

## How to verify a zkLogin signature offchain?

The following options support a zkLogin signature over either transaction data or personal message.

1. Use keytool: See usage in keytool.

```bash
$SUI_BINARY keytool zk-login-sig-verify -h
```

2. Use a self hosted server endpoint: See usage in [zklogin-verifier](https://github.com/MystenLabs/zklogin-verifier).
